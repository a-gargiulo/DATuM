#    PROFILES' ORIENTATION
#        * PIV profiles are extracted either in a direction normal to the tunnel port wall or locally normal to the
#          surface of the BeVERLI Hill, as specified above under 'ORIENTATION'. For profiles taken normal to the hill
#          surface, additional parameters such as the Spalding fitand integral boundary layer parameters are reported
#           below for each profile in the 'AUXDATA' section. The methods used to calculate these parameters are detailed below within this section.
#
#    SPALDING FIT PARAMETERS:
#        * Where appropriate, i.e., for profiles that or normal to their local surface, the data was fitted to the
#          Spalding [1] composite profile to determine corrections to the profile's distance from the surface, X_0 and
#          Y_0, and the friction velocity, u_tau. In such cases, these parameters are reported above.

#                 455-458.
#
#    BOUNDARY LAYER PARAMETERS:
#        * Where available, boundary layer parameters computed using two methods, Griffin et al. [2] and Vinuesa et al. [3],
#          are provided above. The boundary layer thickness, delta, is reported based on either
#          99% or 95% of the edge velocity, U_e, depending on which yielded a more robust estimate, or
#          based on 2.0% of the turbulence intensity.

#
#    UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION (UQ):
#        * The reported uncertainties represent 95% confidence intervals and account for both epistemic and aleatory
#          sources of uncertainty. The epistemic component arises from the rotation angles used to transform the raw PIV
#          data from the local measurement coordinate system to the present Cartesian coordinate system. The aleatory
#          component reflects random sampling variability inherent to the measurements. In the dataset, the uncertainties
#          are labeled by prefixing quantities with the letter 'd'.
