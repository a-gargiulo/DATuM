#    HILL SURFACE NORMAL VS. TUNNEL PORT WALL NORMAL PROFILES: 
#        * PIV profiles are extracted either in a direction normal to the tunnel port wall or locally normal to the
#          surface of the BeVERLI Hill, as indicated under 'ORIENTATION'. For hill surface normal profiles, additional
#          parameters are included under 'AUXDATA' in the dataset, such as the friction velocity, u_tau, corrections to
#          the profile's distance from the surface, X_0 and Y_0, and boundary layer parameters.
#
#    SPALDING FIT PARAMETERS:
#        * Where appropriate, i.e., for profiles that or normal to their local surface, the data was fitted to the
#          Spalding [1] composite profile to determine corrections to the profile's distnace from the surface, X_0 and
#          Y_0, and the friction velocity, u_tau.

#                 455-458.
#
#    BOUNDARY LAYER PARAMETERS:
#        * Where available, boundary layer parameters computed using two methods, Griffin et al. [2] and Vinuesa et al. [3],
#          are provided under 'AUXDATA' in the dataset. The boundary layer thickness, delta, is reported based on either
#          99% or 95% of the edge velocity, U_e, depending on which yielded a more robust estimate.

#
#    UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION (UQ):
#        * The reported uncertainties represent 95% confidence intervals and account for both epistemic and aleatory
#          sources of uncertainty. The epistemic component arises from the rotation angles used to transform the raw PIV
#          data from the local measurement coordinate system to the present Cartesian coordinate system. The aleatory
#          component reflects random sampling variability inherent to the measurements. In the dataset, the uncertainties
#          are labeled by prefixing quantities with the letter 'd'. 
#
#    UNAVAILABLE VALUES:
#        * Fields with a value of -999.9 represent unavailable data points
#
#    AUXDATA:
#      * Boundary layer thickness, delta99 or delta95 (m)  
#      * Boundary layer displacement thickness, delta* (m)  
#      * Boundary layer momentum thickness, theta (m) 
#      * Corrections for the profile's distance to the wall, X_0 and Y_0 (m)
